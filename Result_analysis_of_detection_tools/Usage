This file describes the use of performance evaluation scripts. At present, these scripts are for reference only.

The snp_comp.pl file is to compare the accuracy  between ground-true and detected SNPs, the output is number of consistent SNPs.

The indel_comp.pl file is to compare the accuracy  between ground-true and detected indels, the output is number of consistent indels.

The deletion.pl file is to compare the accuracy  between ground-true and detected deletions, the output is number of consistent deletions.

The inversion.pl file is to compare the accuracy  between ground-true and detected inversions, the output is number of consistent inversions.
